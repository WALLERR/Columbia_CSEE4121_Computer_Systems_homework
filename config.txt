Use the program in Part 1 Task 2 to take “enwiki_small.xml” as input to generate the graph.

Single Node
spark.executor.cores:  4
spark.driver.cores:  4
spark.executor.memory:  5g
spark.driver.memory:  1g


Use the program in Part 1 Task 3 to take the graph you just generated and output a rank list of the articles in the dataset.

3 Nodes

spark.executor.cores:	4
spark.driver.cores:	4
spark.executor.memory:	5g
spark.driver.memory:	5g


(Optional) Use the stream emitter you wrote in Part 2 Task 2 to emit the rank list output in the previous step to a local directory while using the stream receiver you wrote in Part 2 Task 1 to dynamically read the files and generate the output mentioned in Part 2 Task 1.

Single Node
